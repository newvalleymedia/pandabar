# PandaBar #

PandaBar is a package for reading and **grading** 2D barocdes according to the appropriate ISO standard.
the package is supplaied as a static or dynamic library, for the windows environment only.
For now only the "datamatrix" symbology is supported, but I'm planning to do the 3 major symbologies, where the packgae will auotmaticlly detect the symbol type.

  * For now, perspective images are not supported.
Reading and grading 2D barcodes is planned for the following symbologies:

  1. Datamatrix
  1. QRcode
  1. PDF417
